## My process
  First create a link to my style sheet, create a div with the container class with the image and corresponding texts, then modify the div with my data.
In css I imported the font and removed the padding, margin and gave all the texts the imported font, then I centered the div and gave color to the background, with .container I gave it its respective design and size and then shaped the image . With the text below the image I gave it its color and measurements, the same with the paragraphs and the content of the .attribution. Finally, thanks to a media query, I reduced all sizes by 7% so that the mobile size fits well.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to shade a container, how to correctly center it and the calc() function

### Continued development

In future projects I will focus on better understanding hexadecimal, HSL and RGB colors for their correct use.
